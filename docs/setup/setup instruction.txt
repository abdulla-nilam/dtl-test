Tech Stack
===========
	1. Laravel 9
	2. PHP 8.1 - alpine
	3. Docker
	4. MySQL
	5. MongoDB
	6. MailTrap.io (for test mails)
	7. Postman

Requirements
===========
	1. Docker
	2. MongoDB tool(Mongo Compass or NaviCat)
	3. Postman Tool

Additional Resources
===================
	1. MailTrap added to test mail. (skip the email body.)(screenshot provided)
	2. All the working screenshots have been attached(under "docs" folder). 
	3. postman collection added. (Filename  "postman_collection.json" under "docs" folder)


Improvements can implement
=======================
	1. Can merge "Index()" method and "Search()" method into one function("index()"). Written separately for more understanding
	2. Can written code in "try{}catch{}" or "Transection mode" for better error handling. For this, it will be overkill, so it skipped.
	3. we can use "readme.MD" for documentation. 

Followed
=======
	1. Well-commented code
	2. Return type and PHPDoc added. (We know what we get as output).
	3. SOLID pattern followed. 
	4. Consistency responses(API returns) are added all over the system.

Setup Instructions
=================
	1. Install Docker with necessary configs(Ex: if Windows WSL2)
	2. clone the project and go to the root folder
	3. RUN "docker-compose build" and then "docker-compose up"
	4. open another terminal and RUN "docker exec -it dtl_app bash" && then RUN "composer install"
	5. hit "http://localhost:8092/", and you will see the Laravel home page
	6. Open postman and import the postman collection in the root(under the "docs" folder)
